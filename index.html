        <h1>Decolonized Future</h1>
        <p>The project aims to create a decolonized environment based on ideals of social justice, racial equality, and
        environmental responsibility. By engaging both looking to the future through speculative world-building exercises and
        looking to the past to recontextualize forgotten technology to suit modern needs, to envision a speculative decolonized
        urban future.
        During the project, our team explored different types of tools, such as MagicaVoxel and AR converter to build
        interactive 3D models.

        Talking about the ideology of placing importance on local wisdom and indigenous innovation.</p>
